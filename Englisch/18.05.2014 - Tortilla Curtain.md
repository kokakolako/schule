    -   America wants to find an illegal job to feed her family (→ It's
        a shame for Candido)
-   Two dogs are killed by a coyote and the people of the gated
    community (where the Mossbachers are living) are scared by -- from
    their point of view -- potentially criminal, illegal immigrants →
    The community wants to build a wall
-   Candido gets a free turkey at a grocery store → Candido tries to
    roast the turkey and is accidentally responsible for a big fire
-   America gives birth to a daughter (Socorro)
-   Delaney tracks Candido and follows him to the shack of America and
    Candido (Delaney carriers a gun)
