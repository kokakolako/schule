# The Great Chain of Being

* Everyone and everything is arranged in a specific order (= hierachy)
* Human beings can violate the natural order of things by using force to improve their positions, e.g. rebelling against the King → chaos follows, e.g natural catastrophies, egoism, violence in society, personal disasters (!= godfather)
* Order -- disorder -- disaster
* Patron = nobel man with money (!= godfather)
