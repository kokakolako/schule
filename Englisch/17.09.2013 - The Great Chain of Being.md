# The Great Chain of Being

* Everyone and everything is arranged in a specific order (= hierachy)
* Human beings can violate the natural order of things by using force to improve their positions, e.g. rebelling against the King -> chaos follows, e.g natural catastrophies, egoism, violence in society, personal disasters
* Order -- disorder -- disaster
