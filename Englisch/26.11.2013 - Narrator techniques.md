===================

Omniscient narrator
-------------------

-   Knows every character's thoughts, feelings etc.
-   Reader gets insides, can see upcoming conflicts

First-person narrator (I-narrator)
----------------------------------

-   Reader has direct access to a characters thoughts and feelings
-   It is easier for the reader to identify and to feel sympathy
-   The reader experiences everything through one perspective
-   The reader feels closer to character

Third-person (selective) narrator
---------------------------------

-   Story is told from one character's perspective
-   Reader has "indirect" access to the character
