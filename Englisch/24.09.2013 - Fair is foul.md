# What would happen in society if the moral values were reversed?

The complete life would be different but in a very negative and cruel way. 
I would conclude something like this because of the fact that everything that was in the present good would be no evil. 
It would be allowed to kill peope and to do what everyone belongs to.

# Examples of reversed values

When you grow up you can dicover the world around you and at a time you became interested in the news of the world. 
And than you can realise the wars and other cruel things that happen in other countries on the planet.
It is one of the "wendepunkte" of my life for example. 
Also at a view back into the human history you can discover the cruality the happened before. 
In fact better education results in more knowledge about cruel things. 
This could be on the one side very disturbing on the other side it results in a learning process and disacters and catastrophies could be prevented.
